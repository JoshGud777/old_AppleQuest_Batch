<a name="what-is-applequest" class="anchor" href="#what-is-applequest"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is AppleQuest?</h2>

<p>A text based single player RPG programmed in the Batch.  The main goal of AppleQuest is to show that even a very basic scripting language like Batch can be used to create a fun and interactive game.  There will be quests, 5 worlds and a fighting system designed to be easy to use and to maintain.  Other later features include classes, better leveling system and more.  This project is also open to any and all who may want to help.  Though you will want to read over any and all code before making changes.</p>

<a name="what-is-batch" class="anchor" href="#what-is-batch"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Batch?</h2>

<p>Batch is a scripting language that was developed to ease the work required for certain regular tasks by allowing the user to set up a script to automate them.  When a batch file is run, the shell program (usually COMMAND.COM or cmd.exe) reads the file and executes its commands, normally line-by-line.  Since cmd.exe runs the file line-by-line this introduces some limitations in functionality. We can usually get around some of these issues by creating a sub or function to handle all the nitty gritty things.  If you want to learn about Batch I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RootOfTheNull">RootOfNul's</a> Youtube channel. He has many tutorials of both batch and other programming languages. </p>

<p>So, you want to help. Well that's awesome, we’re always looking for more people to give their input. If you're looking to add a feature please submit an issue with the feature you want us to implement and we’ll try to include it into the game. Now if you're looking to help with the programming, please fork the project and edit the code there then submit a pull request to have the change included in the next update. E-mailing one of the other programmers is always a good idea as well. Please pass all ideas through the issues page before writing code for it. If your fixing code it’s fine to just submit the pull request and then explain  it in the comments. Including making code into functions so that those pieces can be used in other areas of the game.  Any edits to documentation just have to be summit as pull requests. There is no need to make a issue on them first. Can’t wait to see your contributions!</p>
